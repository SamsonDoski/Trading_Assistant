# Trading_Assistant
This trading assistant tests and compares moving average crossover strategies across multiple tickers, ranking them by riskâ€‘adjusted performance. It identifies the best MA pair for each stock, simulates weighted portfolios, and guides capital allocationâ€”helping traders build profitable, resilient systems ready for realâ€‘world deployment.
Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a **polished, professional GitHub README** draft for your trading assistant, using the technical terms weâ€™ve been working with and explaining exactly what each file/folder does so anyone landing on your repo instantly understands it.

# **Riskâ€‘Adjusted Multiâ€‘Ticker MA Strategy Engine**  

A modular, Pythonâ€‘based backtesting and portfolio simulation framework for **moving average crossover strategies**.  
It evaluates both **fastâ€‘reacting MA pairs** (e.g., 7/30) and **slow trend filters** (e.g., 50/200) to determine **perâ€‘ticker strategy fit**, ranks them by **riskâ€‘adjusted performance**, and simulates weighted portfolios for **survivability and scalability**.

## ðŸš€ **Features**
- **Custom MA Pair Testing** â€” Compare shortâ€‘term vs longâ€‘term crossovers per ticker  
- **Risk Metrics** â€” Total Return, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Riskâ€‘Adjusted Score (Return Ã· |Max DD|)  
- **Ticker Personality Mapping** â€” Match strategy style to each stockâ€™s behavior  
- **Portfolio Simulation** â€” Combine weighted equity curves, measure diversification and combined drawdown  
- **Forwardâ€‘Test Ready** â€” Modular design for integration with live data feeds and automation

## ðŸ“Š **Example Workflow**
1. Define MA pairs and tickers in `strategy_config.py`  
2. Run `backtest_engine.py` to generate perâ€‘ticker results  
3. Use `risk_metrics.py` to calculate riskâ€‘adjusted scores  
4. Feed results into `portfolio_simulator.py` for combined performance  
5. Review outputs in `/results` and visualize in `/notebooks`

## ðŸ§­ **Vision**
This engine is built for traders who want **clarity, survivability, and adaptability** â€” turning raw backtest data into a **deployable, riskâ€‘aware trading plan**.
